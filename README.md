customogl
=========

L4D2 custom campaign modifications intended for the Promod competitive config.
Initially introduced publicly by the <a href="http://www.l4d2cct.com">L4D2 Custom Campaign Tournament</a>.
The project currently is structured to directly support <b>Promod</b> but it
is basically just a bunch of stripper config files, some of which reference some
vscripts.  If your server has stripper installed, you can use customogl pretty much.
