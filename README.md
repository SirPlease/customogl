customogl
=========

L4D2 custom campaign modifications intended for the Promod competitive config.
Initially introduced publicly by the <a href="l4d2cct.com">L4D2 Custom Campaign Tournament</a>.
The project currently is structured to directly support <b>Promod</b> but it
is basically just a bunch of stripper config files, some of which reference some
vscripts.  If your server has stripper installed, you can use customogl pretty much.

Supported Campaigns

* Detour Ahead
* Carried Off
* Dead Before Dawn 2: DC

* Haunted Forest
* Arena of the Dead 2
* Firetower Trail v2.4
